# My Classic Game Recreation Project

## Overview
I recently completed a project where I recreated a game reminiscent of the classic "Duck Hunt."

## Features
- **Game Mechanics**: Players shoot at moving ducks on screen, using mouse clicks.
- **Animations**: Implemented animated sprites for the hunter and ducks.
- **Dynamic Movement**: Focused on the smooth and realistic movement of game elements.
- **User Interface**: Included a '-h' option for instructions and user inputs.

## Enhancements
- **Levels**: Added different levels for varied gameplay.
- **Scoring System**: Implemented a system to track player scores.
- **Custom Cursor**: Designed a unique cursor target for a more engaging experience.

## Reflection
This project was not just about replicating a classic game but also infusing it with my own creative touches to enhance player enjoyment.
